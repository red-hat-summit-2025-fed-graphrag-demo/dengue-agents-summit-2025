prompt: "The user's query is <query>{{message}}</query>. \nToday is {{current_date}}.\
  \ \n\nStep 1: Think about any references to dates in the query. What date are they\
  \ talking about? \nStep 2: Analyze the query and return a JSON with only the following\
  \ data: \n{\"countries\": [a list of the countries mentioned in the query], \"dates\"\
  : [a list of the dates mentioned in the query, in YYYY-MM-DD format]} \n\nIf there\
  \ is a partial date, such as month and year, then assume the first day of the month.\
  \ \n\nIf there is a reference to something like \u201Cnext May\u201D or \u201Clast\
  \ October\u201D, then assume the reference date is {{current_date}} when you think\
  \ about what \u201Cthis December\u201D, \u201Clast October\u201D, \u201Cnext May\u201D\
  \ is. \n\nOnly include full dates in the output array. \nDo not include the results\
  \ of your thinking steps in the output. Only include the required JSON."
