**DENGUE DATA STATISTICS FOR SAUDI ARABIA**
- Recent trend: Dengue fever cases have been stable recently
- Average cases: 0.0 cases per reporting period
- September forecast: Low risk - historically lower transmission in this month

### Travel Recommendations

Your patient has an **increased risk profile** due to prior dengue infection. Secondary dengue infections can potentially lead to more severe manifestations including dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. Therefore, extra precautions are warranted:

#### Essential Preventative Measures
- **Mosquito avoidance is critical**:
  - Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or IR3535
  - Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants treated with permethrin
  - Stay in accommodations with air conditioning and window/door screens
  - Use bed nets if sleeping areas are not well screened
  - Avoid outdoor activities during peak mosquito hours (early morning and late afternoon)

- **Medical preparations**:
  - Schedule a pre-travel consultation 4-6 weeks before departure
  - Ensure travel health insurance covers medical evacuation
  - Carry a medical alert card noting history of dengue
  - Pack a personal supply of acetaminophen (avoid NSAIDs due to bleeding risk)
  - Identify medical facilities at destination in advance

#### During Travel
- Implement mosquito precautions from day one
- Stay hydrated and get adequate rest to maintain immune function
- Seek medical attention immediately if experiencing fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint/muscle pain, or rash

#### Return Considerations
- Monitor for symptoms for 14 days after return
- Inform healthcare providers about travel history and previous dengue infection if symptoms develop

### Special Considerations for Prior Dengue Patients

Recent research suggests that patients with prior dengue infection may experience:
- Potentially stronger and faster immune response to new exposure
- Higher risk for more severe disease manifestations with subsequent infections
- Possible cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses

While Saudi Arabia currently shows low dengue activity, urban centers can support Aedes mosquito populations year-round, and climate change has expanded potential transmission zones. Riyadh and Jeddah have periodically reported cases in recent years.
